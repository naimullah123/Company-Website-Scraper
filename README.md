# Company-Website-Scraper
Overview

This project is a lightweight web scraper that converts a company website URL into a structured Company Info Record.

The goal is not exhaustive scraping, but reliable extraction of business-relevant signals such as:

What the company does

Its offerings and target customers

Proof points (pages, signals, social links)

Contact and hiring signals

The system prioritizes truthful extraction, explicitly marking data as "Not found" when unavailable.
